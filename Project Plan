The original project plan was to create a program that allowed you sort and filter through all types of baseball statistics. The final project plan was similar but included
only the basic baseball statistics rather than all of them. This had to change because there are way too many baseball statistics and some of them work completely differently
than the statistics that I was used to, so I decided to choose which statistics were in the tables.
